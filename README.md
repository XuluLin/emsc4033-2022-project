# Implementation of frequency-time normalisation
Xulu Lin (u6989382)

## Introduction
This repository contains Python scripts for frequency-time normalisation (Shen et al., 2012). Frequency-time normalisation is an improved normalisation method for ambient-noise cross correlation. The paper provides a detailed explanation of the theory. However, the code is not made available publicly. The Python scripts in this repository are written for users that need comprehensive modules to implement frequency-time normalisation.
