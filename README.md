# Implementation of frequency-time normalisation
Xulu Lin (u6989382)

## Introduction
This repository contains Python scripts for frequency-time normalisation (Shen et al., 2012). Frequency-time normalisation is an improved normalisation method for ambient-noise cross correlation. The paper provides a detailed explanation of the theory. However, the code is not made available publicly. The Python scripts in this repository are written for users that need comprehensive modules to implement frequency-time normalisation. 

## Installation
You will need Python to execute the modules. Note that it is written and tested in the 'Jupyter notebook' interactive Web-based platform with ipython kernel. It is not written for command-line environment. You will also need multiple pre-installed Python packages. Please refer to `src/dependencies` for more details.
